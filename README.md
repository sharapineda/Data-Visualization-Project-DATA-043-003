# Data-Visualization-Project-DATA-043-003

This Data Visualization project is the final requirement for course DATA-043-003 being taught to Data Science Continuing Education students in Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT).  The project serves to consolidate the learnings acquired throughout the course and to showcase the important role of visualization in communicating trends, patterns, and relationships in data.

This article aims to provide a practical guide to designing an insightful dashboard tailored to a specific dataset that both technical and non-technical audience can utilize as reference, employ as a framework, and help refine. The visualization developed for this project utilizes PowerBI aligning with the technology taught in the Data Science Continuing Education courses.
